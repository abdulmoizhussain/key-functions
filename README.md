# Key Functions (A better copy of [make-it-searchable](https://github.com/abdulmoizhussain/make-it-searchable))
### Removes all special characters from the text in Clipboard (which makes it google searchable) and saves it back into Clipboard.

## Executables are in: [Executables/](https://github.com/abdulmoizhussain/key-functions/tree/master/Executables)

### Antiviruses may detect it as a virus, because it is developed with a [key-logger (recorder)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging) mechanism but surely does not log (record) any key, so you can whitelist it.

## Usage:
### Execute ***`key-functions.exe`*** OR ***`key-functions.jar`***

### `Set Cursor position (0, 0) while typing`: ###
* Adding hide mouse-pointer while typing is a tricking functionality, that's why setting cursor's position to (0, 0) coordinates.

### `Clean special characters from clipboard`: ###
* E.g. text: `https://github.com/key-functions/edit/master/README.md`
* Prepend the text with "`mis `" like below and select it:
* !["mis https://github.com/abdulmoizhussain/key-functions"](https://github.com/abdulmoizhussain/key-functions/blob/master/example.png)
* To make it google searchable, copy it from the keyboard shortcut `ctrl + c`:
* Now paste it somewhere and it should be formatted like this: `https github com key functions edit master README md`
